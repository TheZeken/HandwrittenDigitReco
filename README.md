# HandwrittenDigitReco
## Presentation
This Github is about a project that we needed to do during our last year of Master Degree. We needed to implement a handwritten digit recognition tool while simultaneously avoiding the use of Deep Learners as the primary classification method. Instead, a K Nearest Neighbor algorithm was executed and fine tuned, resulting in highly accurate digit recognition performance.

## How to use it
To launch our tool you first need to download all of the files, install the MySQL Database, and then simply launch "interface.py".
